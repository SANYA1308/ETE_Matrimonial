          <p className="leading-relaxed"> Pooja's mother called on our number one evening and then we talked over phone. After sharing some photos of our families over whatsapp, it turned out that our families already knew each other for a long time. Then after finalization we got engaged on 6th May 2022 and we got happily married on 21st November 2022. Thank you PerfectMatch for helping me finding my match.</p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed">I went in small town in my car to see her for first time. I was going to meet her on Sunday. But thought it might not be a click, coz on a video call we couldn't give a thumbs up. So requested her to meet an evening before. She agreed and we sat in a restaurant. God had different plans. We clicked a bit. Then we had a stroll in a quiet street nearby. Our stroll stretched to 4 hours. So we decided to meet next day for the whole day outing. Slowly things started taking shape and I was visiting her almost every week. Then we got engaged after 4 months of dating. Another two months we got married. We had a beautiful pre wed.</p>
